Description: 

LinkedOut borrows the polished interface of LinkedIn to reveal what lies beneath curated professionalism. Through playful interactions, it invites users to hover, discover, and rethink what “connection” truly means.

Abstract:

LinkedOut reinterprets the aesthetics and language of LinkedIn through a shanzhai lens—borrowing, twisting, and playfully subverting the culture of professional self-display. The project doesn’t aim to reject LinkedIn’s world of ambition and optimism, but to reveal the more authentic, sometimes humorous perspectives hidden under its surface. By using “hover” as a storytelling device, LinkedOut turns everyday interface gestures into moments of discovery—users glimpse unfiltered voices, shifting relationships, and the fluid boundary between the personal and the professional. The result is not simply a critique, but a reflection on how digital identities oscillate between sincerity and performance, distance and intimacy.
