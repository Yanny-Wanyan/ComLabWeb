                                                                                 ð“†£    Approach Drill    ð“†£

                                            Your objective is to achieve Tactical Stealth by mastering your internal discipline. You must maintain 
                                            absolute silence, unwavering patience, and extreme steadiness. You must maintain absolute silence, 
                                            unwavering patience, and extreme steadiness. Do not get sloppy now; your success hinges entirely on your 
                                            self-control.

                                            This entire phase is a Real-World Evasion Simulation. You must scroll down the observation field below 
                                            at a pace that realistically simulates slow motion. If your scroll is too fast, your eye will fail to 
                                            register the Target's tiny form, and you will miss your only window of attack. Proceed with the extreme, 
                                            calculated precision required to hunt a minute enemy.
