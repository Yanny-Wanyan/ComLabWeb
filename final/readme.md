# 月亮粑粑(Moon Baba)
**A Playful Web Tale Inspired by a Hunan Rhyme**

Moon Baba adapts a whimsical Hunan nursery rhyme where ordinary moments slip easily into magical transformations. Brought into the medium of the web, the story reveals itself through gentle interactions—small scrolls, brief hovers, quiet clicks—echoing the playful rhythm of the original chant. Guided by a focus on simplicity, warmth, and childhood imagination, the project invites viewers to drift through a soft, ever-shifting world without explaining its inner workings. It offers a light, curious space where folklore unfolds at its own pace, encouraging visitors to follow the tale with openness and wonder.
